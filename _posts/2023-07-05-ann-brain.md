Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained significant attention in the field of Deep Learning, driven by the belief that they can replicate the functioning of our brains.
Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent figure in the development of ANNs, argues that the brainâ€™s ability to learn through connection strengths serves as the foundation for creating
intelligent machines. In a 2019 interview with Nicholas Thompson, Hinton emphasized the importance of mimicking this process in ANNs. This article delves into the perspectives
of Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun on the potential of ANNs to map our natural neural networks and examines their predictions for the future of artificial intelligence.
