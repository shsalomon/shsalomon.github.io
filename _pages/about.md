Welcome to my personal website!🤗

I'm a PhD student in **Data Science for Engineering** at **Paderborn University**, in **Germany**.<br />
As a member of the AI junior research group “Multicriteria Machine Learning – Efficiency, Robustness, Inter-activity and System Knowledge”, I'm currently working with Jun.-Prof. Dr. Sebastian Peitz on the development of efficient optimization algorithms for training neural networks regarding multiple conflicting objective functions.<br />

Glad you visited my page. You can take a look at my latest post, and if you enjoyed it, the previous ones will be thrilled to have you!🤗👐 <br />
I will be happy to receive feedback from you. **Stay connected !** 💪
