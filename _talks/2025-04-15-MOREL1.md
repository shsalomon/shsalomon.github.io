The Sorrento Meeting is a special version of the DALI meeting held in Sorrento. Conceived with the same spirit of DALI, there's also the opportunity to submit a single-authored paper for potential presentation during the plenary session.
The idea of DALI (Data, Learning and Inference) is to combine the special qualities of the former Snowbird meetings (intimate atmosphere, very good people, plenty of time to interact) with attractive aspects of larger conferences that rarely take place in Europe. We use a three-day format with two days of workshops and one day of plenary talks in the middle, including a poster session. We pick a location that limits jet lag and / or travel times for many of us who normally travel to meetings in the US. The workshops feature research topics of current interest, and workshop participants are nominated by the workshop organizers. DALI is small and (geographically) biased towards European researchers. Participation is by invitation only.
