6th European Conference on Computational Optimization (EUCCO): 
The EUCCO conference series aims to bring scientists from computational optimization, algorithms for large-scale optimization problems and related applications together. The 2023 edition especially emphasized optimization with partial differential equations, large-scale optimization, as well as numerical optimization algorithms and software.
