34th European Conference on Operational Research (EURO 2025): 
The EURO-k Conferences serve as vibrant hubs for European Operational Researchers to connect, collaborate, and share their brilliance. With a wide-reaching focus, these conferences bring together OR enthusiasts from all corners of the discipline, from theory to practice, for a lively exchange of ideas, knowledge, and groundbreaking results. Over the past 50 years, the EURO-k series has hopped around 23 different countries â€“ proving that good research knows no borders (and neither do conference organisers)!
